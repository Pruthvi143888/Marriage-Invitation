										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-6736 alignleft" alt="man3" src="https://the-wedding-day.vamtam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/man3.png" width="279" height="299" srcset="https://the-wedding-day.vamtam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/man3.png 279w, https://the-wedding-day.vamtam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/man3-247x265.png 247w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" />Aristotle made several efforts to explain how moral conduct contributes to the good life for human agents, including the Eqikh EudaimonhV and the Magna Moralia, but the most complete surviving statement of his views on morality occurs in the Eqikh Nikomacoi.</p>
<div class="push" style='height:10px'></div><em>There he considered the natural desire to achieve happiness, described the operation of human volition and moral deliberation, developed a theory of each virtue as the mean between vicious extremes, discussed the value of three kinds of friendship, and defended his conception of an ideal life of intellectual pursuit.</em></p>
<div class="push" style='height:10px'></div>But on Aristotle’s view, the lives of individual human beings are invariably linked together in a social context. In the Peri PoliV he speculated about the origins of the state, described and assessed the relative merits of various types of government, and listed the obligations of the individual citizen.<br />
Working from home meant we could vary snack and coffee breaks, change our desks or view, goof off, drink on the job, even spend the day in pajamas, and often meet to gossip or share ideas. On the other hand, we bossed ourselves around, set impossible goals, and demanded longer hours than office jobs usually entail. It was the ultimate “flextime,” in that it depended on how flexible we felt each day, given deadlines, distractions, and workaholic crescendos.</p>
<p>Successful people ask better questions.There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</p>
