We would say hi to each other in the hall if we ever saw one another, but never really went out of our way to talk to one another.<\/p>\n<p>One night a few of my coworkers invited me to a concert they were going to, they said a lot of work people would be there and it would be fun. I love music so I said ok! At the concert I was just sitting there enjoying the music when Nick walked up to me and asked how I was enjoying the concert, I said it was great, and invited him to sit next to me. We got to talking and ended up talking for the rest of the concert.<\/p><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n<div class=\"row \"><div class=\"wpv-grid grid-1-1  wpv-first-level first unextended\" style=\"padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px\" id=\"wpv-column-87304628ae1f87ee89395a162665e634\" ><div class=\"row \"><div class=\"wpv-grid grid-2-5  first unextended animation-from-left animated-active\" style=\"padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px\" id=\"wpv-column-ed04bd4c88587ecb5b58b38add7d3384\" ><div class=\"push\" style='height:200px'><\/div>\n<h2>We\u2019re Engaged!!<\/h2>\n<h4>This day I marry my friend, the one I laugh with, live for, dream of, and love<\/h4>\n<p>Nick and I had talked about marriage and knew without a shadow of a doubt we were going to get married, we even spent a Saturday afternoon looking at rings!
