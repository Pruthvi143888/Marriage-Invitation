At Bender\u2019s invitation, he joined the prestigious Roxburghe Club, an association devoted to fine printing and high standards in book arts. He learned much about printing techniques, inks, design, and layout which he later applied to other projects. [1]Some of Adams\u2019 success can be attributed to how successfully he replicated his work through printing. This week we\u2019ll be learning about his print techniques and making some prints of our own.<\/p>\n<p>Typi non habent claritatem insitam; est usus legentis in iis qui facit eorum claritatem.
